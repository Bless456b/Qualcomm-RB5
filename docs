Tflash (TurboX Flash) is an image burning tool developed by Thundercomm. It can be used to flash FlatBuild
onto Thundercomm SOM modules.
Tflash includes two versions: Windows graphical interface version and Ubuntu command-line version. This
document will introduce the usage of the Ubuntu command-line version.
Thundercomm releases the Ubuntu version of Tflash in the form of deb packages and integrates Tflash into
the TurboX SOM SDK Manager (referred to as "sdkmanager") versions 18.04-3.2.0 and 20.04-1.2.0 onwards.
Thundercomm has performed comprehensive testing on Tflash within sdkmanager, and thus it is
recommended for users to use sdkmanager directly.

FlatBuild is an image format released by Thundercomm, which can be flashed in EDL (Emergency Download)
mode. When a device is unable to boot due to software issues, you can repair it by flashing FlatBuild.
